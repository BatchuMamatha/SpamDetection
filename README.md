# SpamDetection
Title: Spam Detection Using Naive Bayes Classifier

Description:
This project aims to develop a spam detection system using the Naive Bayes classifier algorithm. Spam emails have become a significant problem in today's digital world, and this project provides an effective solution by utilizing machine learning techniques.

The project's source code, provides a comprehensive implementation of the spam detection system using the Python programming language. The code is organized into various modules and follows best practices for readability, maintainability, and extensibility.

Key Features:
-Dataset Preprocessing: The project includes modules to preprocess the email dataset, including text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

-Naive Bayes Implementation: The Naive Bayes classifier is implemented from scratch, using appropriate probability distributions and conditional independence assumptions. This implementation allows customization and parameter tuning based on specific requirements.

-Feature Selection: Different feature extraction techniques are explored to convert text data into numerical feature vectors. Common approaches like bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and n-grams are implemented, allowing users to experiment with different feature sets.

-Model Training and Evaluation: The project provides methods for training the Naive Bayes model on the training dataset and evaluating its performance on the testing dataset. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's effectiveness.

-Real-time Prediction: The trained model can be utilized for real-time spam detection by providing an email as input. The system classifies the email as spam or legitimate based on learned patterns and probability calculations.

Get Started:
Install the required packages/modules :- 
      pip install -r requirements.txt
Then run the main.py to see the results.

With this project, you can quickly implement and deploy a spam detection system using the Naive Bayes classifier, helping to filter out unwanted and potentially harmful emails. Feel free to contribute, experiment with different techniques, and enhance the system's performance.
